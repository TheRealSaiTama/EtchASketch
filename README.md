# Etch-A-Sketch with Python Turtle

## Overview

This Python project replicates the classic Etch-A-Sketch drawing toy. It allows you to draw on the screen using the arrow keys (W, A, S, D) to move the "pen." You can create a wide variety of drawings and patterns just like you used to on the physical toy!
